### What I learned

While working on this project, I learned several important front-end development and responsive design techniques. Here are some of the key learnings:

#### 1. Media Queries for Responsiveness

Applying media queries is crucial to ensuring that your website design is responsive across different screen sizes. Here is an example of how I used media queries in my CSS:

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 1440px){
    body {
        background-color: var(--white);
        width: 50%;
        height: auto;
        border-radius: 20px;
        padding: 50px;
        margin: 100px auto;
        box-sizing: border-box;
    }

    html {
        background-color: var(--eggshell);
    }

    img {
        border-radius: 20px;
    }

    .attribution {
        border-radius: 0 0 20px 20px;
    }
}
```

#### 2. Element Centering

Centering elements on the page is essential for a visually pleasing appearance. Here is how I centered the main container on the screen:

```css
.attribution { 
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    background-color: var(--dark-charcoal);
    color: var(--rose-white);
    font-size: 1.3rem; 
    text-align: center;
    height: 50px;
}
```

#### 3. CSS Variables

Using CSS variables facilitates design maintenance and consistency. Here is how I defined and used CSS variables throughout my project:

```css
:root {
    --nutmeg: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
    --dark-raspberry: hsl(332, 51%, 32%);
    --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --rose-white: hsl(330, 100%, 98%);
    --eggshell: hsl(30, 54%, 90%);
    --light-grey: hsl(30, 18%, 87%);
    --wenge-brown: hsl(30, 10%, 34%);
    --dark-charcoal: hsl(24, 5%, 18%);
}

body {
    font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
    font-size: 16px;
    background-color: var(--white); /* Example of using a variable */
}
```

### Continued development

- Animations and Transitions: I'm still exploring the possibilities of CSS animations and transitions to create more dynamic and interactive interfaces. I want to delve into advanced animation techniques like keyframes, SVG animations, and animation libraries like GreenSock (GSAP).

- API integration with JavaScript: I'm interested in improving my knowledge of modern JavaScript, including features like Promises, Async/Await, and delving into advanced concepts of DOM manipulation and event handling.

- React: While I'm not familiar with the basics of React, I'd like to delve into advanced topics like Context API, React Hooks, React Router, and more complex state management with Redux or MobX.

- CSS Grid and Flexbox: Although I have a basic understanding of Grid and Flexbox, I want to improve my skills to create more complex and responsive layouts more efficiently.
